## ðŸŽ¬ Complete App Store Screenshot Workflow

This demonstrates how to use AppShot's Claude Code commands to generate professional App Store screenshots from scratch.

### Real Example: Meditation App Launch

```
User: Create App Store screenshots for my meditation app "MindfulMoments" 
      with a calming theme in English, Spanish, and French.

        Let me walk you through the complete process.

        a calming, peaceful feeling perfect for a meditation app.

User: /appshot-caption iphone

        - sounds.png: "Soothing Sounds"

        I'll run the caption command for you to add these interactively.

        appshot localize --langs es,fr --model gpt-4o-mini
